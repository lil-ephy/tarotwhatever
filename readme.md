## Basic logic of Tarot

### Card selection process

The main way to **draw** Tarot cards is:

1. **Randomly shuffle** deck of cards
2. **Randomly select** required number of cards for spread
3. **Reveal cards** in order they are drawn
4. **Provide definition** of the card after it is revealed

### Spreads in Tarot

There are multiple types of **spreads** in Tarot. The most popular **spreads** and their respective **draw** meanings have been included below. All spreads can be prefaced with a **Significator** *(or Signifier)*, traditionally a **trump** or **court** card, which is intuitively and consciously chosen to represent either the **Seeker** or the theme of the reading.

  - Celtic Cross
    - Celtic Cross has predefined placements based on draw order, with placements having predefined meanings. This consists of the *six* initally drawn cards placed in a **Cross** formation and the reamining *four* cards placed in **Staff** formation
    - The **Cross** refers to internal and external life events whilst the **Staff** provides directed examination and context surrounding the aforementioned events
    - Within the **Cross** are the **Wheel** and **Axis** *(or Heart)* formations, the former consisting of cards *three to six* and represents influences on the **Axis**, which consists of cards *one to two* and represents the situation and challenge respectively
    - The **Cross** is then dissected into two lines, the **vertical** – consisting of cards one, two, three and four, representing aspects of the self and internality – and the **horizontal** – consisting of cards one, two, five and six, representing aspects of the physical and externality
